## Directed Graph

A directed graph, or digraph, is a mathematical structure $D = (V, A)$ consisting of a finite set of vertices $V$ and a set of arcs $A$, where each arc is an ordered pair $\langle u, v \rangle$ joining a tail vertex $u$ to a head vertex $v$. The ordering matters: the arc $\langle u, v \rangle$ is distinct from $\langle v, u \rangle$, and in general only one, both, or neither may belong to $A$. This is what separates a digraph from an undirected graph, where an edge $\{u, v\}$ treats $u$ and $v$ symmetrically. Because direction encodes asymmetric relationships — one-way streets, task dependencies, follower relationships on social media, or the flow of causality in a system — digraphs are the natural model whenever "A relates to B" does not imply "B relates to A."

Two structural quantities describe how vertices connect to arcs. The out-degree of a vertex $v$, written $d^+(v)$, counts the arcs leaving $v$ (where $v$ is the tail); the in-degree $d^-(v)$ counts the arcs entering $v$ (where $v$ is the head). Summing over all vertices gives a basic identity:

$$\sum_{v \in V} d^+(v) = \sum_{v \in V} d^-(v) = |A|$$

since every arc contributes exactly one unit to some vertex's out-degree and exactly one unit to some vertex's in-degree.

**Worked example.** Consider a course-prerequisite system with $V = \{$Calculus I, Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Diff Eq$\}$ and arcs $\langle$Calculus I, Calculus II$\rangle$, $\langle$Calculus I, Linear Algebra$\rangle$, $\langle$Calculus II, Diff Eq$\rangle$, $\langle$Linear Algebra, Diff Eq$\rangle$. Here Calculus I has out-degree 2 and in-degree 0; Diff Eq has out-degree 0 and in-degree 2. The arc $\langle$Calculus I, Calculus II$\rangle$ correctly encodes "Calculus I must precede Calculus II" — an undirected edge would lose this ordering entirely.

**Problem-solving application.** Digraphs support a distinct family of algorithms tied to direction: topological sorting (arranging vertices so every arc points forward, used above to schedule the four courses validly), detecting cycles (a prerequisite chain that loops back on itself signals an infeasible schedule), and computing reachability (can a student get from Calculus I to Diff Eq by following arcs?). When modeling a system, the first diagnostic question is always whether the relationship between two entities is inherently one-directional — if so, a digraph, not an undirected graph, is the correct representation.

## Directed Walks Paths Cycles

In a digraph, a **directed walk** is a sequence $v_0, a_1, v_1, a_2, v_2, \dots, a_k, v_k$ where each arc $a_i$ goes from $v_{i-1}$ to $v_i$ — vertices and arcs alternate, but unlike in undirected graphs, every arc must be traversed in the direction it points. You cannot "go backward" along an arc even if you visited its head already. The length of the walk is $k$, the number of arcs used.

Refining this notion mirrors the undirected case: a **directed trail** is a walk that repeats no arc; a **directed path** is a walk that repeats no vertex (and hence no arc). A **directed cycle** is a directed path $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k$ together with the closing arc $v_k \to v_0$, so that the sequence returns to its start with no other vertex repeated. The key structural fact is that reachability in a digraph is a one-way relation: the existence of a directed walk from $u$ to $v$ does not imply one exists from $v$ to $u$. This asymmetry is what makes directed cycles significant — a digraph with no directed cycle (a DAG, directed acyclic graph) admits a topological order, while a digraph containing one does not.

**Worked example.** Consider the digraph with arcs $A \to B$, $B \to C$, $C \to D$, $D \to B$, and $C \to A$. The sequence $A, B, C, D, B$ is a directed walk of length 4 — it revisits vertex $B$, so it is not a path, but it uses no arc twice, so it is a trail. The sequence $B, C, D, B$ is a directed cycle of length 3, since it returns to its starting vertex without repeating any interior vertex. Note that although $C \to A$ exists, there is no arc back from $A$ to $C$, $D$, or $B$ directly except through the walk $A \to B \to C$ — so while $D$ can reach $A$ (via $D \to B \to C \to A$), $A$ cannot reach $D$ at all, since every arc out of $A$'s reachable set loops back into $\{B, C\}$ without ever pointing to $D$.

**Problem-solving application.** To detect whether a digraph contains a directed cycle, perform a depth-first search while tracking, for each vertex, whether it is unvisited, currently on the recursion stack ("in progress"), or fully finished. If the search ever follows an arc into a vertex still marked "in progress," that arc closes a directed cycle — this is called a back edge, and its detection is the standard algorithmic test, running in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time, for confirming a digraph is a DAG before attempting a topological sort.

## Underlying Graph

A digraph $D = (V, A)$ consists of a vertex set $V$ together with a set of arcs $A \subseteq V \times V$, where each arc $(u, v)$ points from $u$ to $v$. The underlying graph of $D$, often written $G(D)$, is the undirected graph obtained by replacing every arc $(u, v)$ with an undirected edge $\{u, v\}$, and discarding any duplicate edges that result from pairs of opposite arcs $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$. Formally, $G(D) = (V, E)$ where $E = \{\{u, v\} : (u, v) \in A \text{ or } (v, u) \in A\}$. The underlying graph strips away directionality while preserving exactly which vertices are connected to which.

**Worked example.** Consider a digraph with vertices $\{a, b, c, d\}$ and arcs $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, $(c,a)$, and $(c,d)$. In the underlying graph, these become the edges $\{a,b\}$, $\{b,c\}$, $\{a,c\}$, and $\{c,d\}$ — a triangle on $a, b, c$ with a pendant edge to $d$. Notice that if the digraph also contained the reverse arc $(b, a)$, the underlying graph would still have just one edge $\{a,b\}$, since undirected edges have no notion of multiplicity from opposing directions unless the graph is explicitly defined as a multigraph.

**Problem-solving application.** The underlying graph is the standard tool for importing undirected-graph properties into digraph analysis. A digraph $D$ is called weakly connected precisely when its underlying graph $G(D)$ is connected — that is, there is an undirected path between every pair of vertices, even if no directed path exists in either direction. This is weaker than strong connectivity, which requires a directed path both ways between every pair of vertices in $D$ itself. To test weak connectivity algorithmically, you do not need any directed-graph machinery: build $G(D)$ by dropping arc directions, then run a standard breadth-first or depth-first search from any vertex. If that search reaches every vertex, $D$ is weakly connected. This reduction is useful in practice — for example, when checking whether a one-way street network still allows every intersection to be reached from every other if you're allowed to walk against traffic, or when verifying that a citation network (where arcs point from citing paper to cited paper) forms a single connected cluster rather than several disconnected islands.

## Strong Weak Connectivity

A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ organizes its vertices around two distinct notions of "being connected," and the difference matters because directed edges only let you travel one way.

**Definition.** A digraph is *strongly connected* if for every ordered pair of vertices $u, v \in V$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ (and consequently one from $v$ to $u$ as well). A digraph is *weakly connected* if the graph obtained by replacing every directed edge with an undirected edge — the *underlying graph* — is connected, meaning some path exists between every pair of vertices when direction is ignored. Every strongly connected digraph is weakly connected, but the converse fails: a digraph can be weakly connected while having no vertex that can reach any other vertex by following edge directions.

**Worked example.** Consider vertices $\{A, B, C\}$ with edges $A \to B$, $B \to C$, and $C \to A$. This digraph is strongly connected: you can reach $A$ from $B$ by continuing to $C$ then $A$, and similarly for every other pair, because the edges form a directed cycle. Now remove the edge $C \to A$, leaving only $A \to B$ and $B \to C$. The underlying undirected graph is still a connected path $A - B - C$, so the digraph remains weakly connected. But it is no longer strongly connected: there is no directed path from $C$ back to $A$ or from $C$ to $B$.

**Problem-solving application.** Strong connectivity partitions a digraph into maximal subsets called *strongly connected components* (SCCs), where each component is itself strongly connected and no larger subset containing it would be. Determining these components is a standard algorithmic task, solved efficiently by algorithms such as Kosaraju's or Tarjan's, both running in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time. This decomposition is not just theoretical bookkeeping — it is the key first step in analyzing systems modeled as digraphs. For example, in a citation network, an SCC reveals a cluster of papers that mutually cite one another (directly or through a chain); in a web-crawling or dependency-resolution context, collapsing each SCC into a single "super-node" turns the original digraph into a directed acyclic graph, which can then be safely processed in topological order. Recognizing whether a system is only weakly connected, versus genuinely strongly connected, tells an engineer immediately whether full mutual reachability can be assumed or must be separately verified.

## Communication Network Routing

A communication or transportation network is naturally modeled as a directed graph, or digraph: nodes represent routers, servers, cities, or intersections, and directed edges represent one-way links — a fiber line with asymmetric bandwidth, a one-way street, or an uplink that has no matching downlink. A digraph is **strongly connected** if, for every ordered pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$. This is the precise condition under which any node can route a message to any other node without relying on an intermediary that might fail or be unreachable in return.

**Worked example.** Consider four routers $A, B, C, D$ with directed links $A \to B$, $B \to C$, $C \to D$, and $D \to A$. Every vertex reaches every other vertex by following the cycle around, so the network is strongly connected. Now remove the edge $D \to A$: packets can still travel $A \to B \to C \to D$, but nothing can return from $D$ to $A$, $B$, or $C$. The network has lost strong connectivity, even though it remains connected if you ignore edge direction — a distinction that matters enormously for routing but is invisible if you only check "is the network connected" using an undirected view.

Not every real network is strongly connected, so the practical question becomes: which subsets of nodes *are* mutually reachable? A **strongly connected component** (SCC) is a maximal set of vertices where every pair is mutually reachable. A key structural fact is that the SCCs of any digraph partition its vertex set, and if each SCC is contracted to a single super-node, the resulting **condensation graph** is always a directed acyclic graph (DAG) — it can never contain a cycle, since a cycle spanning two condensed nodes would mean they should have been merged into one SCC. This theorem is what makes SCC decomposition useful: Kosaraju's algorithm computes it in $O(V + E)$ time using two depth-first search passes, one on the graph and one on its edge-reversed transpose. For a network engineer, running this algorithm identifies exactly which clusters of nodes can freely exchange traffic and where a one-way bottleneck would isolate a region if a single link failed.

## Payoff

Every communication system, transportation grid, and social platform can be represented as a digraph: nodes are routers, cities, or accounts, and directed edges are the links along which information, traffic, or influence can flow. The question that matters operationally is not just "is the network connected?" but "can every node reach every other node, in both directions, reliably?" This is precisely what strong connectivity answers, and it is the natural capstone of this book because it takes an abstract graph-theoretic property and turns it into an engineering requirement.

Recall that a digraph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex, and weakly connected if the underlying undirected graph is connected but directed paths may not exist both ways. In a network built from strongly connected components, any router can send a packet to any other router and expect an acknowledgment to return; in a merely weakly connected network, traffic can flow "downstream" but never come back, which is a fatal flaw for protocols that require handshakes, retransmission requests, or routing table updates. This is why engineers test for strong connectivity before deploying a topology, and why algorithms like Tarjan's or Kosaraju's, which find strongly connected components in linear time $O(V + E)$, are standard tools in network design and analysis.

Consider a mesh of data centers connected by fiber links, each link directed because bandwidth or peering agreements are asymmetric. If the graph decomposes into two strongly connected components with only one edge running between them, that edge is a single point of failure: sever it, and one cluster can no longer route back to the other, even though data can still flow one way. Identifying this bottleneck is exactly the kind of diagnosis strong connectivity analysis makes possible, and it is why routing protocols (like BGP) and redundancy planning treat "does every node have a return path" as a first-class design constraint, not an afterthought.

Try it yourself: take a directed graph representing a small network of servers, run a strong-connectivity check, and identify which added edge would merge two components into one. That single exercise ties together everything this book has built toward — from the first definition of a graph to the guarantee that a message sent anywhere can find its way back.
