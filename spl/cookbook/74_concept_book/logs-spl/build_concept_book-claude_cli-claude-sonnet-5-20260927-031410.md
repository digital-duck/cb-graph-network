## Social Network

A social network is modeled as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where the vertex set $V$ represents individuals (or organizations), and the edge set $E$ represents a relationship between them — friendship, collaboration, or communication. If the relationship is mutual, the edges are undirected, giving an undirected graph; if it is asymmetric (one person follows another, but not vice versa), the edges are directed, and $G$ is a directed graph. Each edge may also carry a weight representing the strength or frequency of interaction.

Two structural quantities drive most analysis. The degree of a vertex $v$, denoted $\deg(v)$, is the number of edges incident to it — how many direct connections that person has. The graph can also be represented by an adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij} = 1$ if an edge connects vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. For an undirected graph, $A$ is symmetric, and the row sum $\sum_j A_{ij}$ equals $\deg(i)$.

**Worked example.** Consider five students $\{a, b, c, d, e\}$ where friendships are: $a$–$b$, $a$–$c$, $b$–$c$, $c$–$d$, $d$–$e$. Vertex $c$ has degree 3 (connected to $a$, $b$, $d$), while $e$ has degree 1. Notice that $a$, $b$, $c$ form a triangle — a tightly-knit cluster — while $d$ and $e$ are more peripheral. This local density is captured by the clustering coefficient of a vertex $v$:

$$
C(v) = \frac{2 \cdot (\text{number of edges among } v\text{'s neighbors})}{\deg(v)\left(\deg(v) - 1\right)}
$$

For vertex $a$ (neighbors $b$, $c$, connected by one edge), $C(a) = \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2 \cdot 1} = 1$: all of $a$'s friends are also friends with each other.

**Problem-solving application.** These formalisms let you answer concrete questions algorithmically rather than by inspection. To find the shortest chain of acquaintances between two people (the "degrees of separation" problem), run a breadth-first search from one vertex, which finds shortest paths in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time. To identify influential individuals, compute degree centrality (highest $\deg(v)$) or betweenness centrality (vertices lying on many shortest paths, acting as bridges between otherwise disconnected groups). To detect communities — clusters of densely interconnected people, like the $a$-$b$-$c$ triangle above — algorithms partition $V$ to maximize the ratio of within-group edges to between-group edges. These are the same techniques used to design vaccination strategies, rank search results, and detect coordinated inauthentic behavior on real platforms.

## Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality measures how often a vertex lies on the shortest paths connecting other pairs of vertices. A vertex with high betweenness centrality acts as a bridge or bottleneck: information, traffic, or influence flowing between other parts of the network tends to pass through it, even if the vertex itself has few direct connections.

Formally, let $\sigma_{st}$ denote the total number of shortest paths between vertices $s$ and $t$, and let $\sigma_{st}(v)$ denote the number of those shortest paths that pass through vertex $v$ (where $v \neq s, t$). The betweenness centrality of $v$ is defined as

$$
C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
$$

The sum runs over all ordered (or unordered, by convention) pairs of distinct vertices other than $v$. Each term is the fraction of shortest paths between that pair which route through $v$, so $C_B(v)$ accumulates $v$'s "gatekeeping" role across the entire network. To compare vertices across networks of different sizes, this raw score is often normalized by dividing by $(n-1)(n-2)$ for a directed graph, or half that for an undirected graph, where $n$ is the number of vertices.

Consider a simple path graph with five vertices labeled $A$–$B$–$C$–$D$–$E$. Vertex $C$ sits at the center, and every shortest path between a vertex on the left ($A$ or $B$) and a vertex on the right ($D$ or $E$) must pass through it. Computing the sum, $C_B(C) = 5$: it lies on the unique shortest path for each of the five qualifying pairs ($A$-$D$, $A$-$E$, $B$-$D$, $B$-$E$, and $A$-$C$... actually only pairs straddling $C$ count toward it as an intermediate vertex, giving contributions from $(A,D)$, $(A,E)$, $(B,D)$, $(B,E)$). Vertex $B$, by contrast, only mediates the single pair $(A,C)$ and partially $(A,D)$, $(A,E)$, giving it a smaller score. $C$ is the structural bottleneck of the chain.

In practice, betweenness centrality is computed with Brandes' algorithm, which uses breadth-first search from every vertex and back-propagates dependency scores, achieving $O(nm)$ time for unweighted graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges — far better than the naive approach of enumerating all shortest paths explicitly. This metric is the standard tool for identifying critical infrastructure nodes, brokers in social networks, or key intermediaries whose removal would most disrupt communication across a system.
