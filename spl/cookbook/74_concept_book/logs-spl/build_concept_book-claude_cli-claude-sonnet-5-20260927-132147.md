## Directed Graph

A directed graph, or digraph, is a pair $D = (V, A)$, where $V$ is a finite set of vertices and $A$ is a set of arcs. Each arc is an ordered pair $\langle u, v \rangle$, joining a tail vertex $u$ to a head vertex $v$. The order matters: $\langle u, v \rangle$ and $\langle v, u \rangle$ are different arcs, and a digraph may contain one, both, or neither. This is the key distinction from an undirected graph, where an edge $\{u, v\}$ represents a symmetric relationship. In a digraph, the arc encodes direction — a one-way relationship such as "task $u$ must finish before task $v$ starts," "webpage $u$ links to webpage $v$," or "account $u$ transferred money to account $v$."

Two structural quantities matter for every vertex $v$: its out-degree, the number of arcs with tail $v$, and its in-degree, the number of arcs with head $v$. Unlike undirected graphs, these need not be equal at a single vertex, though summed over all vertices they satisfy
$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg^+(v) = \sum_{v \in V} \deg^-(v) = |A|,$$
since every arc contributes exactly one unit of out-degree to its tail and one unit of in-degree to its head.

Worked example: consider a course-prerequisite system with vertices $V = \{$Calculus I, Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations$\}$ and arcs $\langle$Calculus I, Calculus II$\rangle$, $\langle$Calculus I, Linear Algebra$\rangle$, $\langle$Calculus II, Differential Equations$\rangle$, $\langle$Linear Algebra, Differential Equations$\rangle$. Here Calculus I has out-degree 2 and in-degree 0; Differential Equations has in-degree 2 and out-degree 0. A vertex with in-degree 0 is a valid starting point with no unmet prerequisites, and a vertex with out-degree 0 is a terminal course.

Problem-solving application: to determine whether a schedule of prerequisites is even possible to complete, you must check whether the digraph contains a directed cycle — a sequence of arcs $\langle v_1, v_2 \rangle, \langle v_2, v_3 \rangle, \dots, \langle v_k, v_1 \rangle$ that returns to its start. If Differential Equations were mistakenly listed as a prerequisite for Calculus I, the resulting cycle would make the courses impossible to sequence. This cycle-detection question is exactly what algorithms like topological sorting answer, and it depends entirely on treating the arcs as directed rather than symmetric.

## In Out Neighbor Sets

In a directed graph, an arc from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is asymmetric: it establishes a relationship *into* $v$ and *out of* $u$, but not the reverse. Because direction matters, every vertex carries two distinct neighborhoods rather than one. The in-neighbor set of $v$, written $N^{-}(v)$, is the set of all vertices with an arc pointing to $v$:

$$N^{-}(v) = \{u \in V : (u, v) \in E\}$$

The out-neighbor set of $v$, written $N^{+}(v)$, is the set of all vertices that $v$ points to:

$$N^{+}(v) = \{w \in V : (v, w) \in E\}$$

These sets are generally different, and one can be empty while the other is not — a vertex with no incoming arcs (a source) has $N^{-}(v) = \emptyset$, while a vertex with no outgoing arcs (a sink) has $N^{+}(v) = \emptyset$.

**Worked example.** Consider a digraph with arcs $(A,B)$, $(C,B)$, $(B,D)$, $(B,E)$. For vertex $B$: the in-neighbor set is $N^{-}(B) = \{A, C\}$, since both $A$ and $C$ have arcs pointing into $B$. The out-neighbor set is $N^{+}(B) = \{D, E\}$, since $B$ has arcs pointing out to $D$ and $E$. Note that $A \notin N^{+}(B)$ even though $A \in N^{-}(B)$ — the arc $(A,B)$ does not imply an arc $(B,A)$.

**Problem-solving application.** These sets are the operational tool for computing in-degree and out-degree: $\lvert N^{-}(v) \rvert$ is the in-degree of $v$, and $\lvert N^{+}(v) \rvert$ is the out-degree. This distinction matters directly in algorithms. In a dependency graph (say, course prerequisites, with an arc from prerequisite to course), a vertex is ready to be taken only when every member of its in-neighbor set has already been completed — this is exactly the check performed at each step of topological sorting via Kahn's algorithm, which repeatedly selects vertices whose in-neighbor sets (restricted to remaining vertices) are empty. Conversely, the out-neighbor set of a vertex tells you which vertices become reachable, or whose in-degree should be decremented, once that vertex is processed. When implementing digraph algorithms, always ask which of the two sets a given traversal step actually needs — reversing the roles silently produces the wrong result rather than an error.

## Directed Walks Paths Cycles

In a directed graph, a **walk** is a sequence of vertices $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k$ such that for every consecutive pair there is an arc $(v_{i-1}, v_i)$ pointing from $v_{i-1}$ to $v_i$. Direction matters: even if an undirected edge exists between two vertices, a walk can only use the arc that runs the correct way. The length of a walk is the number $k$ of arcs it uses. A **trail** is a walk that never repeats an arc, a **path** is a walk that never repeats a vertex, and a **directed cycle** is a walk with $v_0 = v_k$, length at least 1, and no repeated vertices among $v_0, \dots, v_{k-1}$. A single arc from a vertex to itself is called a loop and counts as a cycle of length 1.

Consider a digraph on vertices $\{A, B, C, D\}$ with arcs $A \to B$, $B \to C$, $C \to D$, and $D \to A$. The sequence $A, B, C, D, A$ is a directed cycle of length 4: it returns to its start, repeats no vertex before closing, and every step follows an arc in its listed direction. Note that $D, C, B, A$ is *not* a walk here at all, since the arcs run the opposite way — this is the essential difference from undirected graphs, where reversing a path is always valid.

Whether a directed path exists between two vertices is a reachability question, and it underlies practical algorithms: a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph is only possible because no directed cycle exists to create a circular dependency, and detecting a directed cycle (for example, in a build system or a course-prerequisite graph) is exactly how software flags an impossible dependency chain. To check whether vertex $Y$ is reachable from vertex $X$, you search for *any* directed walk from $X$ to $Y$; since repeating a vertex never helps reach a new place, it suffices to search for a directed path — a fact that justifies bounding search algorithms like depth-first search to run in time proportional to the number of vertices and arcs, since no path needs to revisit a vertex. This equivalence between "some walk exists" and "some path exists" is what makes reachability decidable efficiently rather than requiring an exhaustive search over infinitely many walks.

## Indegree Outdegree

In a directed graph, every arc points from one vertex to another, so it is natural to ask, for a given vertex, how many arcs point into it and how many point out of it. The **indegree** of a vertex $v$, written $\deg^-(v)$, is the number of arcs having $v$ as their head (the arc's terminus). The **outdegree**, written $\deg^+(v)$, is the number of arcs having $v$ as their tail (the arc's origin). Together these two numbers describe the local "traffic pattern" at $v$: how much flows in, and how much flows out.

**Worked example.** Consider a directed graph with vertices $\{A, B, C, D\}$ and arcs $A \to B$, $A \to C$, $B \to C$, $C \to D$, $D \to A$. To find the indegree of $C$, count arcs whose head is $C$: both $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ qualify, so $\deg^-(C) = 2$. Its outdegree counts arcs whose tail is $C$: only $C \to D$, so $\deg^+(C) = 1$. Repeating this for every vertex gives the pair $(\deg^-, \deg^+)$ for each: $A:(1,2)$, $B:(1,1)$, $C:(2,1)$, $D:(1,1)$.

A key structural fact follows immediately from how arcs are counted: every arc contributes exactly one unit to some vertex's outdegree and exactly one unit to some vertex's indegree. Summing over all vertices, this gives the handshake-type identity for directed graphs,

$$
\sum_{v \in V} \deg^-(v) = \sum_{v \in V} \deg^+(v) = |E|,
$$

where $|E|$ is the total number of arcs. This is worth checking against the example above: the indegrees sum to $1+1+2+1=5$, the outdegrees sum to $2+1+1+1=5$, matching the five arcs in the graph.

**Problem-solving application.** Indegree and outdegree are the first diagnostic tool for reasoning about directed graphs, especially in algorithmic contexts. A vertex with indegree zero has no prerequisites and can serve as a starting point in a topological sort (used in scheduling tasks with dependencies). A vertex with outdegree zero is a sink — a natural endpoint, such as a final task or an absorbing state in a Markov chain. In network flow problems, a mismatch between total indegree and total outdegree at a vertex signals that the vertex is a source or sink of flow rather than a pass-through node. Before applying any deeper algorithm to a directed graph, computing the indegree and outdegree sequence is a quick way to locate these special vertices and sanity-check the arc count.

## Underlying Graph

Given a digraph $D = (V, A)$, the underlying graph is the undirected graph $G(D) = (V, E)$ obtained by replacing every arc with an edge and discarding direction. Formally, for every ordered pair $(u, v) \in A$, we add the unordered pair $\{u, v\}$ to $E$. If both $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$ appear in $D$ — a pair of antiparallel arcs — they collapse into the single edge $\{u, v\}$ in $G(D)$, since a simple undirected graph does not distinguish multiplicity of direction. This operation is a projection: it forgets orientation entirely while preserving which vertices are connected to which.

The underlying graph matters because many structural questions about a digraph are really questions about connectivity that do not depend on direction. For example, a digraph is called weakly connected precisely when its underlying graph is connected — that is, when you can travel between any two vertices while ignoring arrow directions, even if no directed path exists in either direction. This is a strictly weaker condition than strong connectivity, where a directed path must exist both ways.

**Worked example.** Let $D$ have vertex set $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and arc set $A = \{(1,2), (2,3), (4,3), (4,1)\}$. To build $G(D)$, drop the arrows: $E = \{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{1,4\}\}$. The underlying graph is a 4-cycle. Notice that $D$ itself is not strongly connected — there is no directed path from vertex 3 back to vertex 1 — yet $G(D)$ is connected, so $D$ is weakly connected.

**Problem-solving application.** The underlying graph is the tool of choice whenever a property is orientation-independent. To test weak connectivity of a digraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs, construct $G(D)$ (in $O(m)$ time, merging duplicate edges from antiparallel arcs) and run a single breadth-first or depth-first search from any vertex; the digraph is weakly connected exactly when that search reaches all $n$ vertices, giving an $O(n + m)$ algorithm rather than requiring $n$ separate directed reachability checks. The same reduction underlies algorithms for finding weakly connected components, for planarity testing of digraphs, and for computing the underlying graph's degree sequence, where each vertex's total degree in $G(D)$ equals the sum of its in-degree and out-degree in $D$ (adjusted downward by one for each pair of antiparallel arcs it participates in).

## Degree Distribution

For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices, the degree distribution is the function $P(k)$ giving the fraction of vertices whose degree equals $k$:

$$
P(k) = \frac{|\{v \in V : \deg(v) = k\}|}{n}
$$

Here $\deg(v)$ counts the edges incident to vertex $v$ (for a directed graph, in-degree and out-degree are typically tracked separately, giving two distributions). Plotting $P(k)$ against $k$ reveals the overall connectivity pattern of the network: a narrow, peaked distribution says most vertices have similar degree, while a long right tail says a few vertices are far more connected than the rest.

**Worked example.** Consider a small graph with 6 vertices and degree sequence $2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1$. Since $10$ is the sum of degrees, the number of edges is $10/2 = 5$ (each edge contributes to two vertex degrees). The degree distribution is $P(1) = 1/6$, $P(2) = 4/6$, and $P(3) = 1/6$. Reading this table tells you immediately that most vertices are moderately connected, with one endpoint vertex and one better-connected hub.

**Why this matters for problem-solving.** Real networks — the web, social networks, protein interaction networks — rarely look like the example above. Many instead follow an approximately power-law distribution, $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$ for some constant $\gamma$ (typically $2 < \gamma < 3$), meaning the probability of a very high degree decays polynomially rather than exponentially. This produces "hub" vertices whose removal can fragment the network, while removing a random low-degree vertex barely matters — a property exploited in both network design (targeted defense of hubs) and network attacks (targeted removal of hubs). To apply this in practice: given an adjacency list or edge list, compute each vertex's degree in $O(|E|)$ time, tabulate the resulting frequencies to build $P(k)$, and then check whether $\log P(k)$ decays linearly against $\log k$ — a straight line on this log-log plot is the standard diagnostic for a power-law (scale-free) network versus a random or regular one, and it directly informs which vertices matter most for robustness or targeted analysis.

## Orientation

An orientation of an undirected graph $G$ is an assignment of a direction to every edge, turning each edge $\{u, v\}$ into exactly one of the two possible arcs, $(u, v)$ or $(v, u)$. The result is a directed graph $D(G)$, called an orientation of $G$, that has the same vertex set and the same underlying edges as $G$, but now each edge points one way. Orientation is not unique: a graph with $m$ edges has $2^m$ possible orientations, since each edge independently gets one of two directions. Orienting a graph is a common first step whenever a problem depends on direction — one-way streets derived from a road map, dependency order derived from a task list, or flow direction derived from a pipe network.

**Worked example.** Take the triangle graph with vertices $\{A, B, C\}$ and edges $\{A,B\}$, $\{B,C\}$, $\{A,C\}$. One orientation sends every edge "clockwise": $A \to B$, $B \to C$, $C \to A$. This produces a directed cycle — you can walk from any vertex back to itself by following arcs. A different orientation, $A \to B$, $A \to C$, $B \to C$, produces no directed cycle at all; every arc points from an earlier vertex to a later one in the order $A, B, C$. This second type is called an acyclic orientation, and it is exactly the kind of orientation used to encode a valid ordering of tasks with prerequisites.

**Problem-solving application.** Orientation is the standard technique for converting an undirected structure into one that expresses precedence, flow, or causality. Given a project with tasks $A$, $B$, $C$ and required pairings ($A$ must happen before $B$, $B$ before $C$, $A$ before $C$), you orient the underlying edges accordingly, and the resulting acyclic digraph can be topologically sorted into a valid schedule. In network design, orienting the edges of a graph that represents pipes or wires — subject to constraints like "every vertex must have at least one incoming edge" — models feasible one-way flow. When solving such problems, first ask whether the orientation must avoid directed cycles (as in scheduling) or must satisfy degree constraints (as in flow networks); this determines which of the $2^m$ orientations are admissible, and algorithms like topological sorting or flow decomposition can then be applied directly to $D(G)$.

## Strong Weak Connectivity

A directed graph (digraph) consists of vertices connected by directed edges, each pointing from one vertex to another. Connectivity questions ask whether you can navigate between vertices while respecting edge direction. Two distinct notions arise. A digraph is **strongly connected** if, for every ordered pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ *and* a directed path from $v$ to $u$. A digraph is **weakly connected** if the underlying undirected graph — obtained by stripping the direction off every edge — is connected, meaning an undirected path exists between every pair of vertices. Strong connectivity is the stronger requirement: every strongly connected digraph is automatically weakly connected, but the reverse is not true.

**Worked example.** Consider a digraph on vertices $\{A, B, C\}$ with edges $A \to B$, $B \to C$, and $A \to C$. Erasing directions gives an undirected triangle, which is connected — so the digraph is weakly connected. But is it strongly connected? There is no directed path from $C$ back to $A$ or to $B$, since every edge points "forward." So this digraph is weakly but not strongly connected. Now add the edge $C \to A$. Every vertex can now reach every other: $A \to B \to C \to A$ forms a cycle, so $B$ can reach $A$ (via $C$), $C$ can reach $B$ (via $A$), and so on. The digraph is now strongly connected.

**Problem-solving application.** Strong connectivity matters whenever direction encodes an irreversible constraint — one-way streets in a road network, prerequisite chains in a curriculum, or hyperlinks on the web. A city's one-way street grid is only fully navigable (any address reachable from any other by car) if the corresponding digraph is strongly connected; a grid that is merely weakly connected may strand drivers on dead-end loops. Testing strong connectivity efficiently is done with Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithm, both of which run in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time by performing depth-first search and identifying **strongly connected components** — maximal subsets of vertices that are mutually reachable. Contracting each strongly connected component to a single node always yields a directed acyclic graph, called the **condensation** of the original digraph, which is a key tool for analyzing dependency structures where cycles must first be identified and collapsed before further processing.

## Strongly Connected Orientation

An orientation of an undirected graph assigns a single direction to every edge, turning it into a directed graph. A strongly connected orientation is an orientation in which every vertex can reach every other vertex by following directed edges — that is, the resulting digraph is strongly connected. Not every connected graph admits one. If an edge is a bridge (its removal disconnects the graph), then no matter which direction it is given, the vertices on one side can never send a directed path back to the other side. So a necessary condition is that the graph has no bridges, equivalently that its edge connectivity satisfies $\lambda(G) \geq 2$ (every cut requires removing at least two edges to disconnect the graph). Robbins' theorem (1939) states that this condition is also sufficient: a connected graph has a strongly connected orientation if and only if it is 2-edge-connected.

**Worked example.** Consider a graph that is a single cycle on vertices $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$. It is 2-edge-connected, since removing any one edge leaves the rest as a path that still connects all vertices, and no single edge is a bridge. Orient every edge consistently around the cycle, $v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_n \to v_1$. Every vertex can now reach every other vertex by traveling around the loop, so this is a strongly connected orientation. Contrast this with a tree: every edge in a tree is a bridge, so trees (and any graph containing a bridge) can never be oriented strongly connectedly.

**Problem-solving application.** Robbins' theorem is not just an existence statement — its proof gives a constructive algorithm. Run a depth-first search from any vertex and orient every tree edge from parent to child. Because the graph is 2-edge-connected, every non-tree edge must be a "back edge" connecting a descendant to an ancestor in the DFS tree (this is a consequence of the graph having no bridges); orient each such edge from descendant to ancestor. The result is always strongly connected: any vertex can descend to a leaf, cross a back edge up to an ancestor, and continue upward, eventually reaching the root and then flowing back down the tree edges to any target. This algorithm runs in linear time, $O(V + E)$, using a single DFS pass. It has direct engineering relevance: converting a two-way road network or a redundant communication network into one-way links while preserving full connectivity is exactly this problem, and the 2-edge-connectivity check tells you in advance whether such a conversion is even possible before you attempt the orientation.

---

## Payoff

Every construction in this book has been building toward a single question: when can a two-way street network be converted into a one-way system without stranding any driver? Strongly connected orientation answers it completely. Given a connected undirected graph $G$, the theorem states that $G$ admits an orientation of its edges under which every vertex can reach every other vertex if and only if $G$ is 2-edge-connected, meaning $\lambda(G) \geq 2$ — no single edge, if removed, disconnects the graph. This is the natural endpoint of the book because it is not just another property to check; it is a certificate. The condition $\lambda(G) \geq 2$, phrased purely in terms of edge connectivity, guarantees the existence of a directed structure with the strongest possible reachability property, strong connectivity.

The proof of sufficiency is where the earlier concepts converge. Take an ear decomposition of the 2-edge-connected graph, built from a single cycle and successively attached open or closed ears; orient the initial cycle consistently in one rotational direction, then orient each ear as a directed path from one endpoint to the other. Because every edge lies on some cycle in a 2-edge-connected graph, this process never leaves an edge with no valid direction, and the resulting digraph is strongly connected. Degree distribution enters through necessity: a strongly connected orientation requires that no cut edge exist, since a bridge cannot be oriented without breaking reachability in one direction, and the absence of bridges is precisely what edge connectivity measures. Orientation itself is the operation being constrained, and strong versus weak connectivity is the exact property being decided, so the theorem is the point where the assignment problem, the connectivity threshold, and the reachability outcome all resolve into one clean equivalence.

Beyond the graph itself, this result underlies real infrastructure decisions: converting city streets to one-way, designing fault-tolerant communication networks that must survive any single link failure, and routing water or power flow through a grid with guaranteed service in both directions between any two points. Try it yourself: take a small 2-edge-connected graph, perform an ear decomposition by hand, and verify that your orientation lets you travel from any vertex back to itself.
